/**
 *    The opaque keyword marks the type alias for Logarithm as special.
 *    Construction of instances is provided by the Logarithm object, analogous to a companion object for classes.
 *    You do have to define methods like apply yourself, unlike for case classes, where the compiler can generate them.
 *    Any methods you want on Logarithms are implemented as extension methods,
 *    like toDouble, +, and * here. You canâ€™t just call Double methods on a Logarithm.
 *    
 *    You either have to define an extension method for each Double method you want
 *    or
 *    use toDouble, call the method, then convert back to a Logarithm.
